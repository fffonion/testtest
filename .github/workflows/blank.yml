      # This can't be cached, pongo relies on org.opencontainers.image.revision label
      # which should be set to current commit's SHA. pongo uses this label to clone
      # kong-ee repo, checkout it and copy into the dev image.
      # If it there's a way to modify the label after image is built, or pongo has
      # a way to override it, then we can cache it. But this usually takes 30s, so
      # we should be fine-ish.
